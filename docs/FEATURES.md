# General Features:

- (Early game) Events become less frequent and end at around a month. (Note this factors in the "months after apocalypse" sandbox setting.) Before (late game events) picking back up again at day 45 and tapering off for good on day 90.


- Helicopters (and other flying events) will not fly in extremely bad weather, and have a relative chance to crash based on how less than ideal the weather is.


- Crashed helicopters are vehicle objects, which can be looted and slept in.


- There are a variety of helicopters or other flying events each with their own particular behaviors/crews/cargo drops/loot. Scroll down to "events" for more information.


- Players can actually hide from / avoid the helicopter. (The vanilla helicopter "knows" where you are if you step outside while it's active regardless of distance.)


- Indicator system that will point out incoming helicopters, crashes, supply drops, and their overall distance to the player. Player's traits regarding vision impact how far away events have to be for indicators to engage.


- The helicopter casts a shadow to indicate where it is in relation to the player.


- Helicopters can fire on targets. This does not instantly kill but does gravely wound targets and shred clothing. Any form of movement or cover lowers the chance to get hit.


- Fully voiced announcements, which can be easily expanded upon by others in the future.


- CO-OP/NPC/MP Support: The helicopters will target people depending on their location; prefer targets in the cities over those in the forest. The system will target players and NPCs from the popular NPC mods.


- Helicopter events are registered on AEBS (radio system) just like vanilla events!


- Flares to attract events!

# Events Currently in the mod:   
[**Current Presets**](https://github.com/sharkster91/ExpandedHelicopterEvents/blob/main/Contents/mods/Expanded%20Helicopter%20Events/media/lua/shared/ExpandedHelicopter02a_Presets.lua)  
_Values not found here use the default variables from the main file. Presets all use the same values, mixed and matched for different effects. Some presets inherit from others, some evolve along a progression, and some are randomly picked from a pool._

## EARLY GAME:

- **Military Helicopter:** Initially this helicopter will only make announcements but will over time begin firing on targets;
  at first towards the undead then later, towards players as well.


- **FEMA Emergency Drop:** On occasion and before civilization collapses, a helicopter will drop off an emergency supply drop.


- **Police Helicopter:** These helicopters will patrol early on and fire on undead right away.


- **News Helicopter:** These helicopters will follow their target and most closely resemble the vanilla event.
  However, the player can use cover as well as the indoors to flee the area.


- **Passing Jets:** While not strictly a "helicopter" the jet events whizz near by the player to keep things interesting and move horde of undead early on.


- **Bombings and Air Raid Sirens:** An air raid will signal the shift in events' hostility.


## LATE GAME:

- **The Wolverines:** A group of raiders may fly into the area late in the game. Their harassment will range in severity. The friendliest raider will hover and throw trash at you, while the more hostile will fire upon you.


- **Survivors:** A group of survivors may fly around the area looking for supplies and will buzz past you.


- **The Samaritans:** Deep into the apocalypse, you may encounter a mysterious aircraft that will drop a crate of supplies.
